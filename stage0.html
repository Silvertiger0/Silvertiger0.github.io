      <div><h1>Stage 0: Pre-Programmer</h1>
      </div>
      <div><h2>Let's get started!</h2>
        <p><em>So</em>, here is where I began learning more about becoming a <b>programmer</b>. In this lesson, I learned more about <em><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> and how it works</b></em>. As I began to play around with the <b>effects</b> by using <em>tags</em>, I pondered on what amazing things I could eventually do with them.<br>Perhaps I could come up with a <em>blog</em> or design my own <b>website</b>. <b><em>The possibilities are limitless!</em></b></p>
      </div>
      <div><h2>About <b>THE WEB</b>...</h2>
        <p>This lesson also showed some fun drawings illustrating some basic info about how the internet works. The instructor taught about how the user gets to interact with whatever is on the internet. <em>HTML</em> is what makes up the basic unit of the internet. You can call up and use any kind of file or document through the magic of <em>HTML</em>!</p><p>So, you can acces things on the internet through the use of <em>HTTP</em>. This is how your computer makes requests and receives info from servers all across the world to bring you what you are looking for. You can view this information on your compuer through a <b>browser</b>. There are many kinds of <b>browsers</b> with various attributes. I like Google Chrome and FireFox.</p>

        <h2>Graffiti!?</h2>
        <p>By using tags, we can manipulate how our text behaves on our page.For example, we can make words <b>BOLD</b> by surrounding it with &lt;b&gt; text here &lt;/b&gt; or <em>ITALICIZE</em> with &lt;em&gt; text there &lt;/em&gt;. You can even go as far as to make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCj8Yzx15BA">link</a> to some amazing stuff!</p>
        <!--The first link Is from Wikipedia and the second link I used is from youtube.-->
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>In the box or outside?</h2>
        <p>Elements use two different types, inline and block. Tags that are for block elements create a box where you can have your text while inline is purely text. With block elements, you can have height and width which will give you more options for customization that we will learn about later.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Summary, summary, sum-sum-summary...</h2>
        <p>In this set of lessons, I learned a bit about how html and css work together to make your web pages <em>pop pop <b>pop</b></em>! The instructors discussed briefly how html defines and handles structure of the page while css stylizes your page and the DOM helps organize your web page. Planting Dom trees helps your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHYiyv68q2o">E-vironment</a>. <!--Thanks to youtube for enhancing my links--> Then they broke down how everything is set up in boxes. They even brought on a web developer to talk about how he breaks down developing a web design by making boxes within boxes within boxes... <b>boxeption</b> if you will. Seriously though, using boxes will give you the ability to organize you web pages however you want. They give you much flexibility by giving you parameters that you can manipulate with relative ease. You can store things in them, change their colors, sizes, function, and so much more!</p>

        <h2>What does this button do?</h2>
        <p>By the way, you can use the Developer Tools built into the browser to insect and play around with a websites page. It's a fantastic way to get more familiar with how thaings are laid out in html and css because it can show you how they interact right next to the finished product. You can even alter things on the page to see how changes will effect the page. Don't worry about messing up because all you have to do is refresh the page! So, open up those developer tools and have at it!</P>

        <h2>I want to write my own code!</h2>
        <p>If you want to actually write code and save it, you should obtain a text editor like <em>Sublime</em> or <b>Atom</b>. I like Atom myself. You can use these editors to code in many languages such as <em>html, css, java, markdown, and much more! And it only costs <b>free</b>-ninety nine!</p>
